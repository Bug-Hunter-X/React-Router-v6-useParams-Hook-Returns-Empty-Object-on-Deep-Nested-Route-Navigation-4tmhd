In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component nested deeply inside multiple route paths.  The problem manifests when navigating directly to a deeply nested route using a URL that skips intermediate routes. For instance, if you have routes like `/users/:userId/profile` and `/users/:userId/settings`, navigating directly to `/users/123/settings` without visiting the `/users/123/profile` route first may cause `useParams` to return an empty object or undefined, especially when using server-side rendering or a lazy loading strategy for routes. This occurs because the nested routes may not yet be fully mounted or initialized before `useParams` attempts to access the parameters.
